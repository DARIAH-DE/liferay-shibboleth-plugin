Liferay Shibboleth Plugin
=========================

The Liferay Shibboleth Plugin adapted for CENDARI and DARIAH-DE.
This code was originally forked from the official [liferay-plugins](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins).
Our modifications add several options to the Shibboleth plugin to enable auto-creating
user accounts on first login and mapping of Shibboleth groups to Liferay roles.

**NB**: This altered version of the plugin also contains a workaround for the incorrect decoding of UTF-8
attribute values passed from Shibboleth to the servlet container. This can be enabled in the Shobboleth
plugin options and will re-encode ISO-8859-1 encoded values back to UTF-8. This option should be removed
if/when a better fix is found.

To build:

    mvn package

Then upload the resulting WAR via Liferay's Control Panel -> Apps -> Install action.
